I got a R710


# Getting the server

I got this on craigslist

It appears to be a 

# Upgrading RAM

Putting in all slots dropped it from a nice 1333 to 800

# Upgrading graphics card

The built in VGA is pretty shabby, as you'd expect from a server unit.
Upgrading the graphics is possible thanks to the PCI-E slots in the back.

They're marked for PCI-E x4 and x8, and appear to be the same size...

Be careful about how many pins - amazon sent me one marked for PCI-E x8, but was
actually a x16 (part number specs online agreed).

I returned and new-egg'd a Zotac GT 710 with a PCI-E x1 connection.

I put that in and booted it up, but that didn't work.
Had to power cycle it, so unplug all and let it sit for a few minutes before
rebooting. I think somewhere online said it had to re-negotiate the power
requirements using a hard reset. Then, you can enter the BIOS
(press F2 a bunch between 55 seconds and 75 seconds after boot, let it sit 90
seconds, then move down six fields, press enter, move to bottom of list by 
holding arrow key, press space to toggle between Enabled or Disabled, then press
enter to close, escape to exit, and enter to save and exit, then power off and
on with front button).

Then it worked wonderfully with HDMI out the back.
