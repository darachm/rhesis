[Steven Inness](https://localwiki.org/davis/Steve_Inness) (RIP) 
told me that he wished scientists would,
effectively, livestream their experiments. He used the term webcam
being as he was old skool (phone phreak homebrew computer club old skool), 
but the idea was that scientists should be completely open about what they do.
I believe he thought this was only reasonable, as scientists are public
servants (regardless of funding source) and have a duty of transparency.
This is what we are paid to do - crystalize and communicate.

Being an undergraduate just starting in the lab the idea of someone
someone watching and judging me was terrifying and I categorically
rejected Steve's idea.
But it's been looking like a better and better idea over the years.
What if these records were open and available?
[Open Wetware]() does this as a wiki, sort of.
Can we make it stick?

I hope that I can try this out, now that I got things to share, and see how it
works. The Steve-cam.
