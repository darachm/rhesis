# [Can a biologist fix a radio?](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1535-6108(02)00133-2)

Yuri Lazebnik's commentary uses the example of a 
simple radio to argue for a more theoretical 
and mechanistically fundamental understanding of
biological processes. An argument against genetics,
imho, but also a call to think about these 
limitations as we progress forward.
This is not to say that being
more technically sophisticated is the answer, 
like myriad examples in model system genetics or the recent
"omnigene" articulations of these, 
these make the point that biology is 
complicated. Especially in that last one, a lot of 
folks may feel like this is a case of "no shucks
sherlock", but I think it's important to accept 
and teach ideas as the paradigm so that we can 
immediately get everyone to question them further.

Pair with Kacser's "Some aspects..." 

# [Into the sciences](http://www.librarything.com/work/19756253/book/142780162)

Fredrick Ross is the guy who wrote in a widely circulated blog post: 
["Fuck you, bioinformatics. Eat shit and die."](http://madhadron.com/posts/2012-03-26-a-farewell-to-bioinformatics.html)

Dramatic title.
However, even while disagreeing with Ross I find his arguments very useful in 
thinking about the practice of science. It's even better when I agree!

For example, his perspective on how a non-biologist gets started in biology 
sounds like good advice and I've tried to use it.  I really like the phrase 
"science practitioner".  How you train is how you fight, and how you speak is
how you think, so little turns of phrase like this can be powerful.

# [Some physio-chemical aspects of biological organisation](https://books.google.com/books?id=69l1AwAAQBAJ) 

<span style="background:#fdf;">WARNING CAT PICTURE</span>

This is the appendix to "The strategy of the genes", book of essays by 
Waddington. Kacser contributes the appendix, and for 1957 it's an especially 
prescient call for integrating biochemical modeling at the level of systems 
biology. The meat of it isn't very useful given our progress in abstracting 
these mechanisms but could be handy for someone new to developmental processes.

The best parts are the introduction and conclusion,
and I don't have a scanner so you'll have to be
satisfied with down-scaled cell phone photos or
just buy the book yourself.

Really good conclusion:

Growing up in biology in the Age of the Sequencer,
it has felt like high-throughput biology has pushed
out some valuable reductionist work<sup>1</sup>.
and that the next step with these technologies is 
really to integrate the two so that we're not just 
doing high-throughput screens, we're doing 
high-throughput _measurements_ with assays that are 
readily interpretable back to biophysical properties.

And here's a picture of Tai with the book.
The parts that Waddington wrote are pretty good too,
classic figures. Development. Evolution. Etc.
